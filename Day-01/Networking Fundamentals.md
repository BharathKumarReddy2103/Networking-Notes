# Networking Fundamentals

In today's cloud-native and DevOps-driven world, understanding networking fundamentals is not just optional—it's essential. Whether you're provisioning infrastructure on AWS, deploying containers in Kubernetes, or setting up secure VPCs, networking plays a foundational role in how your applications connect, communicate, and scale.

This guide explains core networking concepts—**IP addresses, IPv4, CIDR blocks, subnets, private vs public networks, and ports**—using practical examples. It is structured for DevOps Engineers, Cloud Architects, SREs, and even Full Stack Developers who need a clear and concise reference on these core topics.

## What is an IP Address?

An **IP address (Internet Protocol address)** is a unique identifier assigned to a device connected to a network. It ensures every device in a network can send and receive data accurately.

Imagine a home with four devices connected to a Wi-Fi network. If all devices shared the same identity, how would you:
- Block Instagram for your child's phone?
- Trace which device accessed a payment website?
- Monitor device activity?

The solution? Assign each device a unique **IP address**.

## IPv4 Format and Binary Representation

The most common form of IP address today is **IPv4**. These addresses appear in the format:

```
192.168.1.10
10.0.2.15
172.16.0.1
```

### Structure:
- Composed of **four numbers** separated by dots (called **octets**).
- Each number ranges from **0 to 255**.
- Total = **4 bytes** or **32 bits**.

### Example: IP `192.168.1.1`
- Convert each number to binary:
  - `192` = `11000000`
  - `168` = `10101000`
  - `1`   = `00000001`
  - `1`   = `00000001`
- Total binary representation:
```
11000000.10101000.00000001.00000001
```

This structure ensures IPv4 can support approximately **4.3 billion unique addresses (2^32)**.

## Why We Use IP Addresses

IP addresses provide:
- **Traceability**: Identify which device performed an action.
- **Security**: Block/allow based on source or destination IP.
- **Monitoring**: Track data usage per device.
- **Routing**: Guide traffic across networks globally.

## Subnets and Network Segmentation

A **subnet** is a segmented portion of a larger network. Subnetting improves **security, isolation**, and **efficiency**.

### Scenario:
In an office, imagine you have:
- A shared Wi-Fi network (free access)
- A secure finance network

If a device in the open network is compromised, all devices on that network are at risk. Subnets allow you to isolate sensitive systems:

```plaintext
VPC: 172.16.0.0/16
  ├── Subnet 1 (Finance): 172.16.3.0/24
  └── Subnet 2 (General): 172.16.4.0/16
```

---

## Private vs Public Subnets

| Type             | Description                             | Internet Access | Use Case                        |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Private Subnet** | Internal use only                      | No               | Databases, internal apps         |
| **Public Subnet**  | Exposed to the internet                | Yes              | Web servers, jump boxes          |

**How to control this**: In cloud platforms like AWS, attach route tables and configure them with or without **Internet Gateways**.

## CIDR Notation Explained

CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) defines IP address ranges using the format:

```
<IP-address>/<prefix-length>
```

Example:
```
172.16.3.0/24
```

- The `/24` means **first 24 bits are fixed**, leaving 8 bits for host addresses.
- `2^8 = 256` addresses.

### Formula:
```
Available IPs = 2^(32 - subnet prefix)
```

| CIDR      | # of IPs | Common Use  |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| /30       | 4        | Point-to-point links |
| /29       | 8        | Small services |
| /24       | 256      | Typical subnet |
| /16       | 65,536   | Large VPCs |
| /8        | 16 million | Class A networks |

## Real-World CIDR Examples

### Example 1: Need 256 IPs for Finance Subnet

```
VPC CIDR: 172.16.0.0/16
Subnet:   172.16.3.0/24 → 256 IPs
```

### Example 2: Need 2 IPs for testing

```
CIDR: 172.16.3.0/31 → 2 IPs (2^1 = 2)
```

### Example 3: CIDR Calculation Practice

- For `/26`:
  ```
  32 - 26 = 6 → 2^6 = 64 IPs
  ```

- For `/8`:
  ```
  32 - 8 = 24 → 2^24 = 16,777,216 IPs
  ```

## Ports and Application Access

A **port** is a unique number assigned to an application on a host to distinguish it from other apps.

### Example:
You deploy two services on the same server:

- App 1: Port `8080`
- App 2: Port `9191`

To access them:
```
http://3.4.5.6:8080
http://3.4.5.6:9191
```

### Best Practices:
- Avoid using default ports for security (e.g., MySQL on `3306`).
- Use non-conflicting ports like `9090`, `9191`, `8000+`.
